<h1>
 📈Fuel-Consumption-prediction - 📑Brief Summary
</h1>

- Used pandas to import and Sanitized the dataset.
- performed EDA using various python libraries like matplotlib,
Seaborn, Numpy
- Build ML models for prediction using libraries Scikit-learn, etc.
- Used Streamlit to deploy the M.L. model.

 👍Descriptive Explanation - 
</h1>

<h2> 
  🥅Objective-
</h2>
The main aim of project is to find the Average fuel consumption of vehicle basis on diffrent parameter like- Vehicle class, Engine size, 
Transmission, Fuel type etc. and to create a U.I. for User to find the consumption according to thier vehicle's Parameter 


<h2> 
  📑E.D.A.-
</h2>

- Before E.D.A did the data wrangling.
- After cleaning did Univariate & Bivariate Analysis to understand the features.

- <h3> Univariate Analysis : </h3>
